# Initial Setup

**Resources** for this experiment can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SrTXSM9n9Ot9OpjQYqxAGZwO3b4I9CQZ?usp=sharing). Please download it before continuing to the next sections.

## **Building:** setting up [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) 

Install [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) on your computer, which is what we will use to build our experiment.  


## **Hosting:** setting up [Pavlovia](https://www.pavlovia.org)

You can go to Pavlovia by clicking the link above or access it directly through the PsychoPy interface as shown below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Accessing Pavlovia through PsychoPy."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/logging-pavlovia.png")
```

Once you have gone to Pavlovia, create an account with your **yorku email address**. York University has an institutional licensing with Pavlovia that allows you to run all your studies **free of cost** under your york email address. 

Once you've created your Pavlovia account, we'll link your local computer to the Pavlovia repository through [gitlab](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/) by using an SSH key. An SSH key lets your computer securely communicate with gitlab so you can push your changes online. 

To access SSH key setup: log onto gitlab using your credentials, then go to __settings__ and click __SSH key__ from the left hand menu bar.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Finding setting on gitlab."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/settings.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="SSH key on gitlab setting."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/ssh.png")
```

You can either generate a [new SSH key](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/help/ssh/README#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair) or use an [existing SSH key](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/help/ssh/README#locating-an-existing-ssh-key-pair). I will summarize the instructions below for generating a new key. 

Open up terminal on your computer and type this at the command prompt to generate a RSA key pair: 

ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -b 4096 -C "example@email.com"

For example:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Command line for generating RSA key pair."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/rsakey_generating.png")
```

Press enter to choose the suggested path. Once the path is chosen, create a password (recommended), or press enter twice to skip creating a password. 

Now that your key is generated, we will add it to the gitlab account.

First, copy your public SSH key by typing in the command below:

**macOS:**
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

**WSL / GNU/Linux (requires the xclip package):**
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

**Git Bash on Windows:**
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip

Once copied, paste it onto your gitlab account under SSH key.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Pasting SSH key onto gitlab."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/ssh_key_paste.png")
```

## **Consent:** setting up consent form through survey website (Qualtrics, Google Form).

[Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) **(recommended)**: At this time, only full-time psychology professors have [access](https://psycentre.apps01.yorku.ca/wp/qualtrics/) to the licensed version of Qualtrics at York University. If you can request your supervisor to create an account for the lab and let you use it then this is most **optimal** option for online experiments. 

[Google Forms](https://www.google.ca/forms/): Can be setup with any Google accounts.


## **Recruitment:** setting up recruitment websites (URPP, Prolific) 

[URPP](https://yorku.sona-systems.com/): accessible to all graduate students through york email. 
Cost of running studies = free

[Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/) : need to create account and input money into account before running studies.
Cost of running studies: to run 40 participants for a 20 minute study shown below so about ~Â£3.33 ($5.6 CAD) per participant. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Prolific cost breakdown."}
