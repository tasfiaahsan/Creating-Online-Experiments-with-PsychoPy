# Overview

When we carry out an in-person experiment, we have three components: 

- **Hosting:** usually a computer in the lab
- **Consent:** paper consent form that is given to participants before they begin
- **Recruitement:** place where we find participants (e.g URPP)

For online experiment, those same three components are replaced by different websites that does each respective job

- **Hosting:** website to host the experiment (i.e, Pavlovia)
- **Consent:** consent form integrated through experiment or survey website (i.e., PsychoPy or Qualtrics)
- **Recruitment:** website to recruite participants from (e.g. URPP, Prolific)

This webpage will go over the steps needed to create a smooth transition from recruiting participants online, redirecting them to sign the consent form and complete the experiment, and then finally bringing them back to the recruitment site to provide automatic compensation.
