Query strings allow us to transfer Participant ID from one website to another. 6.1.1 URPP –&gt; Qualtrics –&gt; Pavlovia –&gt; URPP: Automatic Process Below are the steps required at each website to link everything together. URPP: Create a new study in URPP Under ’Study URL: paste Qualtrics survey link ending in ?id=%SURVEY_CODE%. This will pass the URPP code to Qualtrics through the variable id. Figure 6.1: URL ending, URPP Qualtrics: Go onto URPP code, right click to open options and select default choices Add a new embedded data element, type in id as a variable and click insert. This will allow Qualtrics to recongize the Participant’s ID as the variable id. Figure 6.2: embedded data field, Qualtrics Go to end of the survey, and add ?participant=${e://Field/id} at end of the URL of your experiment. This will rename the SONA and Qualtrics participant ID from ‘id’ to ‘participant’ so Pavlovia can recognize it. Figure 6.3: URL ending, Qualtrics URPP: Go to study page and copy the link under ‘Qualtrics Redirect to a URL’. Return to PsychoPy, and click on Experimenter Settings –&gt; Online tab In ‘Completed URL’ enter the URPP link and change ${e://Field/id} with “+expInfo[‘participant’]” This changes the participant ID variable from ‘participant’ back to ‘id’ so URPP can recognize it and give credit to the participant. Don’t forget to push the changes from PsychoPy to Pavlovia! Figure 6.4: URL ending, PsychoPy 6.1.2 URPP –&gt; Pavlovia –&gt; URPP: Automatic Process URPP: Create a new study in URPP Under ‘Study URL: paste Pavlovia study URL ending in ?participant=%SURVEY_CODE%. This will pass the URPP code to Pavlovia through the variable ’participant’. Go to study page and copy the URPP completeion URL Figure 6.5: URL ending, PsychoPy PsychoPy: Click on Experimenter Settings on PsychoPy –&gt; Online tab Paste the URPP completion URL and add “+expInfo[‘participant’]” to end of it. This allows URPP and PsychoPy to communicate the participant ID through the variable ‘participant’ Don’t forget to push the changes from PsychoPy to Pavlovia! Figure 6.6: URL ending, PsychoPy 6.2 Recruiting from Prolific 6.2.1 Prolific –&gt; Qualtrics –&gt; Pavlovia –&gt; Prolific: Automatic Process Prolific: Create a new study in Prolific Under ‘What is the URL of your study?’: paste Qualtrics survey link and click on ‘I’ll use URL parameters’. which will add the parameters to the end of the Qualtrics URL automatically. Click on ‘Configure parameters’ and change PROLIFIC PID –&gt; participant, STUDY ID –&gt; study_id, and SESSION ID –&gt; session, respectively. This will translate the default prolific variable names to those used in Qualtrics and PsychoPy. Figure 6.7: URL ending, Prolific Qualtrics: Go onto Prolific code section, right click to open options and select default choices Add a new embedded data element, type in ‘participant’ as a variable and click insert. This will allow Qualtrics to recongize the Participant’s ID as the variable ‘participant’.
