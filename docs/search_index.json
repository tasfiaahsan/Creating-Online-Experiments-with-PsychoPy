Query strings allow us to transfer Participant ID from one website to another. 6.1.1 URPP –&gt; Qualtrics –&gt; Pavlovia –&gt; URPP: Automatic Process Below are the steps required at each website to link everything together. URPP: 1. Create a new study in URPP 2. Under ’Study URL: paste Qualtrics survey link ending in ?id=%SURVEY_CODE%. This will pass the URPP code to Qualtrics through the variable id. Figure 6.1: URL ending, URPP Qualtrics: 1. Go onto URPP code, right click to open options and select default choices 2. Add a new embedded data element, type in id as a variable and click insert. This will allow Qualtrics to recongize the Participant’s ID as the variable id. Figure 6.2: embedded data field, Qualtrics Go to end of the survey, and add ?participant=${e://Field/id} at end of the URL of your experiment. This will rename the SONA and Qualtrics participant ID from ‘id’ to ‘participant’ so Pavlovia can recognize it. Figure 6.3: URL ending, Qualtrics URPP: 1. Go to study page and copy the link under ‘Qualtrics Redirect to a URL’. 2. Return to PsychoPy, and click on Experimenter Settings –&gt; Online tab 3. In ‘Completed URL’ enter the URPP link and change ${e://Field/id} with “+expInfo[‘participant’]” This changes the participant ID variable from ‘participant’ back to ‘id’ so URPP can recognize it and give credit to the participant. 4. Don’t forget to push the changes from PsychoPy to Pavlovia! Figure 6.4: URL ending, PsychoPy 6.2 Recruiting from Prolific 6.2.1 Prolific –&gt; Qualtrics –&gt; Pavlovia –&gt; Prolific: Automatic Process Qualtrics: 1. In the first question, we will embed the Prolific code through the right click options –&gt; default choices 2. Add a new embedded data element, type in ‘participant’ as a variable and click insert. This will allow Qualtrics to recongize the Participant’s ID as the variable ‘participant’.
