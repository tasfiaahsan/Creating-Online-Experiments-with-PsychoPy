You are not waiving any of your legal rights by indicating consent. 4.1 Adding consent form through Qualtrics Sign into Qualtrics, Create a new project –&gt; Survey The first question will set up the participant to input their unique identification number. For instance, participants coming from SONA would put in their URPP code. This would be important to identify the participant and in Chapter 6 we will make this an automated process (so participants don’t have to type it in themselves). Figure 4.1: identification code, Qualtrics The next question will be the consent form. This question should be in a multiple choice format with only one choice, and forced response requirement. Setting up this way requires the participant to actively interact with the consent form (click to consent) in order to move to the experiment. Figure 4.2: consent form, Qualtrics The next two questions are there to collect demographic informaiton, so they are optional. Collecting age information Figure 4.3: age information, Qualtrics Collecting gender information Figure 4.4: gender information, Qualtrics At the end of the survey, we want to redirect the participant to the experiment. Select End of Survey –&gt; Redirect to URL: paste the link of your experiment in the box below (will be edited in Chapter 6 for automatic crediting). Figure 4.5: end of survey, Qualtrics Benefit: automatic crediting, clean presentation. Drawback: paid through institutional license 4.2 Adding consent form through Google Forms Sign into Google Forms –&gt; Start a new Blank form Q1: Here participants would need to paste their identification code Figure 4.6: identification code, Google Form Q2: You can copy and paste the consent form here or upload the image of the form for easier formatting.
