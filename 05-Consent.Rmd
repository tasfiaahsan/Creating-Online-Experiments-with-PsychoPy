# **Consent:** Implementing consent form and demographics 
Below is the standard York University consent form template. We will be implementing this into our experiment today.

>
***Informed Consent Form*** – Name of Study
>
***Study name:*** Include the study name. 
>
***Purpose of the research:*** Include a statement about the purpose of the research. Include a statement indicating how the research will be conducted, presented and reported. 
>
***What you will be asked to do in the research:*** Include a statement regarding the role and/or responsibilities of the research participants. Include a statement regarding the estimated time commitment for the participation. If inducements will be offered, indicate them here.
>
***Risks and discomforts:*** Include a statement regarding any real or perceived risks or potential discomfort that may result from participation in the research. If there is a possibility of harm or discomfort it must be described and the mitigation methods must be indicated.

## Adding consent form through [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/)

Sign into Qualtrics, Create a new project --> Survey

1. The first question will set up the participant to input their unique identification number (Participant ID). For instance, participants coming from SONA would put in their URPP code. This is important to annonymously keep track of participants and their data.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="identification code, Qualtrics"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/Q1.png")
```


2. The next question will be the consent form. This question should be in a multiple choice format with only one choice, and forced response requirement. Setting up this way requires the participant to actively interact with the consent form (click to consent) in order to move to the experiment. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="consent form, Qualtrics"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/Q2.png")
```


The next two questions are there to collect demographic informaiton, so they are optional. 

3. Collecting age information
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="age information, Qualtrics"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/Q3.png")
```

4. Collecting gender information 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="gender information, Qualtrics"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/Q4.png")
```

At the end of the survey, we want to redirect the participant to the experiment. Select End of Survey --> Redirect to URL: paste the link of your experiment in the box below (will be edited in Chapter 5 for automatic crediting).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="end of survey, Qualtrics"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/end_of_survey.png")
```

Benefit: automatic crediting, clean presentation. 
Drawback: paid through institutional license

## Adding consent form through PsychoPy

Fitting large bundles of text into PsychoPy can get very messy. The best way to do it is to take a screenshot of the consent form (consent_form.png) and scale the image to fit the screen. Then we can surround it with text on the top and bottom to ask them to read the consent, press 'y' to consent, or press 'escape' key to exit out of screen. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="consent form, PsychoPy"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/consent_image.png")
```

We'll put a text component on the top of the consent form asking participants to review the form. The y position is adjusted to shift the text above the consent form image. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="text component asking participants to review consent, PsychoPy"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/top_text.png")
```

Another text component in the bottom of the consent form will used to ask the participants to consent. We will make this text red in order to capture their attention. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="text component describing how to consent, PsychoPy"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/bottom_text.png")
```

Here we create a keyboard component to register the participant's response to consent. The default key for leaving the experiment is the escape button, so we will set our keyboard keys to 'y' for consenting, and ask participants to press escape if they don't consent.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="keyboard component to consent, PsychoPy"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/key_consent.png")
```

Pro: Free
Con: looks very chunky, requires more techincal skills to get demographics (custom code).

## Adding consent form through [Google Forms](https://www.google.ca/forms/about/)

Sign into Google Forms --> Start a new Blank form

Q1: Here participants would need to paste their identification code
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="identification code, Google Form "}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/q1_form.png")
```


Q2: You can copy and paste the consent form here or upload the image of the form for easier formatting. Reponse is required to move forward.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="consent form, Qualtrics"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/q2_form.png")
```


Q3 and Q4: demographic information as above (age and gender)
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="age & gender information, Google Form"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/q3_q4_form.png")
```

End of survey: ending the survey with the link to the experiment that the participant must click
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="end of survey, Google Form"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/ending_form.png")
```

Pro: Free. Clean presentation, keeps demographics and consent information separate from data.
Con: participants need to click on link to go to experiment. Manual crediting for participation.
