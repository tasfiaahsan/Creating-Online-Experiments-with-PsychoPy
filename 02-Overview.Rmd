# Overview

When we carry out an in-person experiment we require three things: 
- recruiment website: place where we find participants (e.g URPP)
- hosting location: usually a computer in the lab
- consent form: paper consent form that is given to participants before they begin

For online experiment, the same three components are replaced by different websites that does each respective job

- recruitment website: URPP, prolific, mturk
- hosting website: pavlovia
- consent form: qualtrics or integrated into your experiment
