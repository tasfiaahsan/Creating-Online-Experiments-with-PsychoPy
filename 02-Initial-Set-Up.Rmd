# Initial Set Up

## Setting up PsychoPy and Pavlovia

We will be building our experiment in PsychoPy and then running them online on Pavlovia. 

To begin, install [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) on your computer. Once you have PsychoPy set up on your computer, we will begin setting up for [Pavlovia](https://www.pavlovia.org). You can also access Pavlovia directly from PsychoPy interface as shown below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Accessing Pavlovia through PsychoPy."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/logging-pavlovia.png")
```

Once you have gone to Pavlovia, create an account with your **yorku email**. York University has an institutional licensing with Pavlovia that allows you to run all your studies free of cost under your york email. 

Once you've created your Pavlovia account, we'll link your computer to the Pavlovia reposotory through [gitlab](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/) by using an SSH key. An SSH key lets your computer securely communicate with gitlab so you can push your changes online. 

To access your SSH key setup, log onto gitlab using your credentials, then go to __settings__ and click __SSH key__ from the left hand menu bar.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Finding setting on gitlab."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/settings.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="SSH key on gitlab setting."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/ssh.png")
```

You can either generate a [new SSH key](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/help/ssh/README#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair) or use an [existing SSH key](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/help/ssh/README#locating-an-existing-ssh-key-pair). I will breifly go over how to create your own below:
