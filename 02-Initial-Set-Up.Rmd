# Initial Setup

## **Hosting:** setting up [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) and [Pavlovia]((https://www.pavlovia.org))

We will be building our experiment in PsychoPy and then running them online on Pavlovia. 

To begin, install [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org) on your computer. Once you have PsychoPy set up on your computer, we will begin setting up for [Pavlovia](https://www.pavlovia.org). You can also access Pavlovia directly from PsychoPy interface as shown below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Accessing Pavlovia through PsychoPy."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/logging-pavlovia.png")
```

Once you have gone to Pavlovia, create an account with your **yorku email**. York University has an institutional licensing with Pavlovia that allows you to run all your studies free of cost under your york email. 

Once you've created your Pavlovia account, we'll link your computer to the Pavlovia reposotory through [gitlab](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/) by using an SSH key. An SSH key lets your computer securely communicate with gitlab so you can push your changes online. 

To access your SSH key setup, log onto gitlab using your credentials, then go to __settings__ and click __SSH key__ from the left hand menu bar.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Finding setting on gitlab."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/settings.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="SSH key on gitlab setting."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/ssh.png")
```

You can either generate a [new SSH key](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/help/ssh/README#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair) or use an [existing SSH key](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/help/ssh/README#locating-an-existing-ssh-key-pair). I will summarize the instructions below for generating a new key. 

Open up terminal on your computer and type this at the command prompt to generate a RSA key pair: 

ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -b 4096 -C "example@email.com"

For example:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Command line for generating RSA key pair."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/rsakey_generating.png")
```

Press enter to choose the suggested path. Once the path is chosen, create a password (recommended), or press enter twice to skip creating a password. 

Now that your key is generated, we will now add it to the gitlab account.

First copy your public SSH key by typing in the comman below:

**macOS:**
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

**WSL / GNU/Linux (requires the xclip package):**
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

**Git Bash on Windows:**
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip

Once copied, paste it onto your gitlab account under SSH key.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Pasting SSH key onto gitlab."}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tasfiaahsan/Creating-Online-Experiments-with-PsychoPy/images/ssh_key_paste.png")
```

## **Consent:** setting up consent form through PsychoPy or through survey website (i.e, [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) - recommended).

At this time, only full-time psychology professors have [access](https://psycentre.apps01.yorku.ca/wp/qualtrics/) to the licensed version of Qualtrics at York University. If you can request your supervisor to create an account and let you use it, then I would highly recommend using this option to organize your consent forms.


## **Recruitment:** setting up [URPP](https://yorku.sona-systems.com/) and [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/)
