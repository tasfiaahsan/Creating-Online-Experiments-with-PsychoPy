# Building an experiment with PsychoPy

## We will be using the PsychoPy Builder to create the Posner Cuing Task Experiment.

**Posner Cuing Task**
Participants will see a fixation cross in the middle and one box to the right and one box to the left. A cue will appear in one of the two boxes followed by a GO signal in either the same box as the cue (congruent) or different place as the cue (incongruent). Participants will be asked to indicate whether they see the GO signal on the right or the left box by pressing S key for right and L key for left. There will be a total of 20 trials.
